# TBook Bounty Program

## Our Goal

Given TBook's accelerating development, we are more committed than ever to building a smoother, safer, and privacy-focused platform. To support this commitment, we are launching a bounty program.

The **TBook Bounty Program** invites community developers to enhance TBook’s functionality, usability, and security. We’re excited to collaborate with the community to propose user experience improvements, identify and resolve vulnerabilities, and develop useful tools for all users.

## Program Objectives

- **Platform Security**: Report vulnerabilities that could impact the platform or user data.
- **User Experience Improvements**: Propose significant enhancements that improve usability or user interaction.
- **Tool Development**: Create tools that support or extend TBook’s capabilities.

## Our Commitment to Security and Privacy

At TBook, we prioritize user security and privacy. As part of this commitment:

- **Platform Enhancements**: We have implemented robust measures to protect user data and platform integrity. For example, we have separated our backend infrastructure to enhance data security and reduce exposure to potential risks.
- **Privacy-First Approach**: We respect user privacy and avoid all unnecessary data collection. Our platform is designed to minimize data retention and only collects what is essential for core functionality.
- **Collaborative Security**: We partner with trusted organizations, such as GoPlus, to strengthen security practices and benefit from specialized expertise.

## Rewards for Contributions

We value contributions that help improve TBook, and we are offering Toncoins as rewards for accepted submissions. Here’s how it works:

- **Base Rewards**: We will distribute Toncoins for verified and constructive submissions, based on the significance of the contribution.
- **Additional Rewards**: For impactful contributions that are well-documented and enhance platform integrity, we will offer additional rewards.
- **Grants**: For contributions that bring highly significant outcomes in any of the objectives listed above, we would love to work with you long term, and you may be eligible for a grant.
